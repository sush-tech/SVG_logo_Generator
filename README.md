## Installation

Check if you have Node.js installed by typing "node -v" in your command line. If node is not installed, visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en) to install. Next, clone this project repository to your computer. Use the command "npm install" to install dependecies. Use the command "npm install --save-dev jest" to install Jest as a devDependency.

## Usage

Make sure to be on the rigth path in Terminal. Run the application by typing "node index.js" or by typing the script "npm start" in the terminal's command line. You will be asked a series of questions before your logo is generated. Once all prompts have been answered with accepted values, your new logo will be generated with the file name 'logo.svg'. Refer back to the video posted in the description as needed.
